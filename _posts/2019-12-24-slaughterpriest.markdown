I had this mini for some time, and finally managed to paint it, right after returning from Hussar. 
This was meant to be a quite quick paintjob, around 10-12 hours I'd say, so he's not going to win anything, but at least I've tried some new stuff like red NMM & stronger light on 28mm. I'm quite pleased with the atmosphere, but there are some things I have to take into account:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*  More structured approach when mixing. My colours stopped to be out-of-the bottle premixes quite some time ago, and I have to keep more discipline for easy back-and-forth when blending. I think I will be going for layer->wetblend->feathering->glaze from now on. 
*  Don't exaggerate NMM so much. Too much light, keep it more sublime, and leave white reflections for ultra clean elvish armours :)
