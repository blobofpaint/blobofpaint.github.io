Hey, 
after a couple of months from start this forgeworld beauty is finally ready:

Nice retro sculpt, before I bought it I also considered getting a leviathan dred, but hey - that's for future project :) Maybe even some nice version for emperors children will be released by then. Quality of cast is not ideal (at least for the steep pricepoint), but managable. I got so tired during painting it that I rushed the last part - hammer. Maybe I'll repaint the handle as some people in the internets didn't like the regularity of reflections. Learned a lot on NMM, got through my greatest nemesis - NMM gold, I think I have a cold variant of it figured out. I think I'll begin to explore material reflections and tonal variety in NMM in my next works. The base was attempted 3 times, in the end did the simplest and safe thing with colors already used on sepulchlar guard bases - a deserty-wasteland with lone imperial fist helmet and some tufts. Overall pretty happy, probably my most time-consuming work so far.

Cya!
