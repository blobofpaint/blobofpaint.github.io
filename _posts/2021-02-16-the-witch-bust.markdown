This one was painted in under a month, which is reaallly fast for me. I love the sculpt, it has some funny details like small teeth, a snake, nicely sculpted hair.
I'm quite happy how it turned out, for future self review let's write what went good, and what could be improved...

The good
*  expressivenes & illustrative style. This is what I like in minipainting, and I'm quite fond that this work further in that direction than before
*  it does not copy any versions I've seen, the color composition was thought out before starting the work. I think there is a good balance between saturation & desaturated colors
*  airbrush smoothing worked, again
*  first time I've painted hair that look interesting
*  brave textures in some places. I really like the chest piece weathered look.
*  snake turned out quite all right. Organic slappy painting suits organic textures well

The bad
*  didn't take any helpful pics during the paintjob. Grayscale pics would help with the lighting. Value is the same on both cold & light sides of the skin, and a grayscale pic would help to tackle that. I think it would be better with more agressive shades on dark side, together with a terminator line it would be more dramatic. 
* Shade the belly button more
*  didn't write down exact recipes, which made it hard to fix mistakes after airbrush stage. This also made me blend the side of face without so much airbrush work and since I didn't have so much patience it shows on closups. Structured approach to blending is required on higher lever works
*  In general, go darker with shades and lower on highlights on skin on lower parts of the model to ephasise focal point (face) even further

The plan for next bust
*  ref pics of all harder elements
*  exact notes of colors
*  put all base colors, plan the secondary light with airbrush. After that, refine
*  more airbrush blending, better detail handling: prepare a more elaborate masking solution to help handling this
*  prepare, read about all solutions before painting the element. I have the literature :)
