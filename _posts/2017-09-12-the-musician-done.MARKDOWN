Hey there!

Finally my first bust, the musician from white tree is finished!
I`m pleased how it turned out, wasn't really tired even at the end, which means that I still like the sculpt, even after 15hrs spent with it.
It turns out that the bigger the model, the more important is smoothness, which is missed in some spots here. Making each layer smooth takes time but it's worth it, and in that case I rushed a bit at the begining. 
New significant tool for my painting: vallejo airbrush cleaner kicks ass, makes it easier to control paint, slightly extends drying time which will be major for wetblending in the future (thanks for the tip Loler :)).

C&C welcome as always
