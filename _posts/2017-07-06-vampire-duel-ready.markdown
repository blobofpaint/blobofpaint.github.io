Now that was a long project... damn, over 6 months - but with a lot of breaks & inbetween painting.
I absolutely love hasslefree minis, their simplicity and cute faces. Dacso from origen art on the other hand kind of dissapointed me, too much detail crammed into tiny space. Nevertheless, both miniatures resonate with each other and add further contrast, apart from light/dark of the terrain.

What was learnt:
-sculpting the wall was a really bad idea, it took a lot of time and the effect is suboptimal. Other material should be used.
-emptiness of the wall could be fixed with a simple window. Blue-tac the minis and check the composition a couple of times before painting.
-lightwork on the terrain was fun. Light side could use more orange.

As usual wip shots/movie can be found on my instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/blobofpaint_minis/

Better photos later!
