I'm not happy with with this one. The main issue is that this sculpt didn't immediately 'click' with me, so I didn't want to spend the time needed to paint it up to my standard.
Nevertheless, I'm glad I completed it, I don't like to keep an unpainted model after the workshop - it was started during one with Krzysztof Kobalczyk at Torun. I took opportunity to experiment with some cold colors, the OSL kinda works I think, and I improved my NMM gold understanding.

Cheers!
