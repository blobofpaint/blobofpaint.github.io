After 3 weeks of not painting (got married though so it's understandable :D), I finally managed to do something - really simple and fun skeleton model from shadespire. GW plastics rock! The aim was to get back in the flow, which I think this model achieved. Overall kinda sloppy paintjob that took 2.5hrs but I enjoyed it very much, being fast also allows me to quickly practice NMM reflections placing.

Now it's time to start some serious work on infinity Penthesilea bootleg biker - miniac meat grinder competition deadline is 30th of June so not a lot of time. Thankfully my motivation is really high nowadays :)

cheers!
