The masque done. 
Prepped, based and painted in 10 days, so my record so far. I'd say everything took around 20hrs of work. 

the good: 
-after some corrections I`m quite happy with the cape
-my recent method of planning the colors by scribbling in photoshop works nicely
-raphael 8404 0 for blending/feathering & w&n miniature series 2 for detail work will probably be my go-to combo for small 28mm minis
-my speed improves
-subassembly + blocking the colour via airbrush works nice

the bad:
-should have spent more time in painting the base. More color nuances/modelling details. 
-her toe-claws should be green, like pincers
-I have to paint something simpler. The sculpt is nice, dynamic, but the amount of meaningless details is too much (mostly the amount of small gems)
-my sculpting skills suck. Had to rebuild the bracelet on her masque-holding arm, and it looks like shit.
-NMM on top of her face needed more attention.
-do I have to be another eye-candy painter? While the colours work nice together, it's pretty close to my gaunt summoner scheme. Need to go more muted & original on next works.
