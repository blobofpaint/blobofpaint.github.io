Stuff here is based on Figopedia book by JBT, which I highly recommend. You can get it here: [https://shop.battlefield-berlin.de/?](https://shop.battlefield-berlin.de/?content=katalog&action=artikelinfo&artikelid=11162&do=1-show-german_infantry_with_camo_winter_jackets.html).

**Colour contrasts**:

1. **Light-dark**

	juxtaposition of dark & light parts
2. **Quantity contrast**

	small focal points painted in using: 
	- contrasting colour
	- temperature
	- saturation
3. **Warm-cool**

	juxtaposition of warm & cool colours (risky) OR cool shadows & warm highlights (+vice versa)
4. **Saturation contrast**

	juxtaposition of saturated & desaturated colours. Desaturated should dominate, saturated parts are focal points
5. **Complementary contrast**

	two complementary colours next to each other. Avoid full saturation of both colours.
6. **Desaturated colour tinting**

	desaturated colour next to saturated colour seems to be tinted with it's complementary colour.
7. **Pure colour**

	juxtaposition of pure colours, most striking with primaries. Very hard to harmonize

**Colour harmony rule**:

1. choose dominant colour for 2/3 of mini, this will be background colour
2. choose secondary colour for 1/3 that goes well with 1)
3. choose focal points colour - very saturated or very contrasting with 1) and 2)

**Highlighting & shading using colour wheel**

1. highlights: white + colour above
2. shades: black + color below
