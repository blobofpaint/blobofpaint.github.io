Bought a box of shadespire skeletons, these are really awsome minis, great sculpts, and I wanted to paint something warhammerish very much recently. Went with classic red/green combo but with slightly different tones, and I think it turned quite good. As someone on facebook pointed out, there is an issue with bone having similar color to NMM, will work on that on next skeletons. The mini took around 6 hours so preety fast for me, aimed for TT+ standard, and I'm modifying my approach to tabletop recently - everything will be painted in NMM. This way I can skip blending work and focus more on believable reflections. Square bases are for Mordheim/Warheim purposes, who knows, perhaps I`ll have a chance to use them there.

As for future projects, there are some competitions in the later part of the year (online and not), and I intend to participate so in june/july I`ll paint a lot. I've got the sacrifice bust already in progress with skin & cape mostly ready:

Penthisilea bootleg prepped & ready to be primed.
I also aim to prepare forgeworld's Iron Circle Battle Automata for warmachine category of Hussar 2018 to try to get honorable mention, but we`ll see how that goes, it will be really complex project painting-wise (NMM + osl planned).

cheers!
