I bought this mini quite impulsively at Hussar, but after seeing the boxart in person I thought it might be a good gateway into large scale minis.
It's nicely sculpted & has everything: metal, skin, some clothes. I've decided to create some bigger scenic base for it as I'm still struggling with base
composition, and practice is everything. Overall I'm quite pleased how she turned out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some thoughts:
*  Colour pallete used is ok. Base could use some more variation though
*  NMM is better, not so bright, more nuanced reflections, I still have to explore more visible colours
*  light is better, but even more contrast is needed between focal points and lower parts 
*  airbrush blending is awsome, need to do it more on big minis like this. It saved the legs from absolute disaster.
*  the freehand is weak, kinda uninspired... also the purple headband could be painted better
*  water - I like it, more contrast perhaps
