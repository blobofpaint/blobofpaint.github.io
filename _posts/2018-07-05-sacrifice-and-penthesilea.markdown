Finally finished sacrifice bust started couple of months ago. Also managed to finish penthesilea bootleg biker - almost a year after receiving it for birthday :)
Both minis will participate with Jareck in 'eadbanger. Penthesilea will also participate in miniac online competitions. The notes here are for my reference, 
compiled from what I think & some online feedback.

__Sacrifice bust:__

the bad:
- skin color is kinda controversional. More red nuances would be good. But I`m glad I tried something different.
- reds are shiny, sux for photos
- some parts are again rushed (hands/leather)
- missing eyebrows (will fix that) 

the good:
- reds are vibrant with nuances
- second light is not ideal but I learned something
- NMM is ok, even though it was done quickly
- definately way better than my first bust, blending is improving

the bad:
- pants blend with bike - should be beige?
- NMM lights are chaotic and incorrect
- bad fitting of her feet to base, hopefully not visible
- some edge lines on bike are too thick

the good:
- everything looks eye-catchy
- my most precise work
- base is kinda nice (compared to my previous work)
- blending on bike is ok
- attention to detail was mostly ok

I already started to work on cleaning up the Iron Circle Domitar Ferrum automata from Forgeworld horus heresy line. 
Epic model with nice details, but for that price the casting could be better. This will be a lot of NMM practice which I need :)

cheers!
