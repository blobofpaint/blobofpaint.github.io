This was a learning excercise: how to make a backdrop. Lessons learned: I have to buy some kind of device that allows me to cut plasticard accurately :)
I don't think I will be scared when attempting a backdrop on some competition-level piece anymore :)
The figure was rushed just to finish it, and it's quite below my standard. But I really like the base & overall mood.

Cheers!
