Cool comic style sculpt from Enigma miniatures, all metal, allowing some configuration options regarding weapons, went for classic big blade though.
I wanted to practice skintones with more structured approach using vallejo fairy skin set, layer+glazes to smooth it out before next layer done usually on separate painting session. Fairy skin is a really good paint set, just mix some grey/green/blue into it and you will have a large variety of skintones for your projects. This was also my first 54mm figure, took around 3 months to finish, but the paining time itself would be around 25 hours. The parts that I'm most happy (not that there are no mistakes there) are skin & bone blade, the blade was problably the most enjoyable part of the mini. I think I'm starting to like green tones a bit. Also for the first time I heavily used my electric drill for pinning/subassembly which helped a lot, I only had to prolong the blade's handle with milliput, as initially it didn't meet with the ground at the mini base. The hair were a bit of a struggle to paint as I`m not the most precise painter, also would prefer to make them red, but such versions of this mini already exist, so I went for more witcher-style colour.

What to improve:

-- blood should be more nuanced & darker, Blood for the blood god straight from the pot is not enough :)

-- there are some mistakes, parts like black straps and blade handle were rushed and require more attention. Don't cut corners!

-- base should have more intense colour, grey is quite boring especially when considering that his hair is also grey.

-- for model with so large skin area, some additional colour nuances on skin would help - the chest is quite flat. If I painted it again I'd go with cold light from one side. Second lights is something I want to explore during next projects.

-- veins on his arms should be subtler, more dilluted turqoise glaze
