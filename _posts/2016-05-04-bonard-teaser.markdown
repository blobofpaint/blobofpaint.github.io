The hat is done, highlights and midtones are warm, for shadows I used GW's technical blood mixed with black and cold blue, just to add some shine, as an experiment. Probably it will be lost after sealer priming. I also tried paint dabbing, interesting technique but hard to get it exactly right. Probably glazed over it too much to be visible. But, I plan to use it on entire figure so I will have plenty of opportunities to practice it. His jacket will be greenish black painted in similar manner.

The gem will be done in the end, when I'll be able to see the whole miniature, then it will be easier to select some appropriate colour.
