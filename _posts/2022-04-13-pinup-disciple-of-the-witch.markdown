Every once in a while I paint something from KD range, I really love those funky figurines. This one seems very similar in pose to my 
54 death armor pinup, so I went in totally opposite direction: no moody light, just saturated colors & slightly comic style skin. 
Edibles were interesting to paint, practiced some skin blending using airbrush & dotted max lights on the skin - such highlights look more natural, 
I think first I've noticed it in Aythami Alonso Torrents videos, it just works. Red stocking was an experiment, first I wanted to imitate latex, 
but in the end it looks a little bit like flayed flesh, which is fine considering the theme of the figure. 
The thing that would need more work is the tv screen, also environmental light from it is missing to push this figure to another level.
