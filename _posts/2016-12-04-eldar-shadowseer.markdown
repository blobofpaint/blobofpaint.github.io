Around 8-10hrs of work, but I really struggled with this mini. The main problem: chalky finish from primer. It was primed during a hot day, long time ago.
Another problem: too much gems. One or two is fine, I just don't like painting them in large quantities. All in all I kind of rushed it in a few places, the finish is definately not smooth. Suprisingly I quite like the final look, and I think the colors scheme works. Lessons learned:
*  think through splitting the mini into pieces before painting. It was hard to get to some places here.
*  color wheel helps, even when deciding what color to use for little things like gems
*  making own plinth stands is really easy. And painting bases can be fun :)

Amplify contrast, continue on harmonizing color schemes, focus on better prep, try more products for basing.
That's the goal for next mini, a classic GW orc shaman. Probably I'll use diy lightbox, so maybe the photos won't suck so much.
