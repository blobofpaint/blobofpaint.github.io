Something quick, a rather simple sculpt with simple base. I wanted to try painting pink fur.
Experimented with vmc Reddish Flesh and Kimera phalto green for skintones, this makes for quite pleasant non-obvious skintones. And as usual recently, magenta for some areas.
A lot of stuff could be improved, mostly blacklining & more accurate tones of pink, but nevertheless I'm quite happy.

Cheers!
