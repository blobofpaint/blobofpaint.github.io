Another speed painted elf from reaper. Took 3-3.5 hours, didn't try to hard, rather quick and sloppy after a longer break.
I like how the cape turned out with purple shadows and yellowish highlights, should have additional final lights but I decided to put the effort in the next mini,
as this one is quite ugly.
