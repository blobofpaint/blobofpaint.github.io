This one was tough to paint, it's a reeaaally small figurine. I'm quite happy how the skin turned out, especially the light, 
the scheme is simple but blue contrasts well with warm flesh. I'm not particularily happy about the hair, 
and the smoke could use some more attention, sword is rushed. The base is quite poor, that's something I have to work on more.
