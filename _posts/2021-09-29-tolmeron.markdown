Project goal was to try to paint an eavy metal marine with simple, edge highlighted armour. This one was painted in around a week and took something close to 12 hours.  
I'm quite happy with colours, NMM, overall precision. And it was quite refreshing to paint a primaris marine, they are really cool, providing some large surfaces with interesting curves. This definately is not my last marine :)

What would be needed to make it better:
- better base, this one was prepared in 30mins after the paintjob (awful thing to do because there is always risk of damaging an already painted figure, I should stick to preparing base build before painting the mini as it works the best)
- blend sword a little bit more, it's not bad, but could be butter-smooth
- stronger edge highlights on the helmet
- use microsol for half skull transfer, round surfaces are pain in the ass for transfers
- use airbrush + masking on yellow parts of his shoulder pads to keep surface smooth. Yellow ohre does not work on big surface very well
