I've picked this mini up because nobody has painted it yet, and I wanted something marine-size and flashy for competitions.
The base built went quite smoothly, and was fun - I imagined the setting like a failed space marine operation in some underhive. 
Finally succeded with two level base that I wanted to do for some time.
I think this is my best model so far, at least technique-wise. 
A lot of time went into figuring out the skin (glazing, airbrush glazing, dotted highlights) and painting colorful NMM. I'm glad I took the time with these things. 
If I had to change something, it would be deeper shadows on brown leather box on his belt and adding some delicate edge highlights on space marine helmet.
