It took some time to finish this mini, just finalized small details. Overally I'm quite happy with how it turned out. Around 10-14hrs? Didn't really count. Some thoughts:

*  I'm a chaotic painter, so leather was real pleasure. Have to try weathered nmm on some bigger surface, should be fun.
*  sanding prep is critical for smoothness on metal minis (very little sanding here impacted the paintjob I think)
*  sculpting simple things with a lot of randomness, like rocks on the base is not that hard
*  osl on irregular surfaces sucks. The skull was no really a good surface to try it, I'm not experienced enough
*  the cloak was supposed to be black, but it turned out ok, at least lighting I guess. Contrasts well with leather? Happy accident :)
*  I really have to print a color wheel!
