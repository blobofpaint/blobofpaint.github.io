Resin wood elf highborn for a friend's mordheim/warheim warband. I'll try not to spend more then 5hrs on him, it's gaming mini after all. I'm thinking bronze nmm, maybe some more ideas will pop out during painting. Photos for light/dark reference:

Previous problems with corax white were caused by lots of paint dust in the air, I guess I have to make the priming faster or switch places if too much paint floats in the air.

Cheers!
