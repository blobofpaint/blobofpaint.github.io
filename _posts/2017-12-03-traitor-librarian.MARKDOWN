&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

After almost 2 months of painting (around 35 hours) I finally managed to finish this mini. 
Lots of details on this one, I guess it's my first marine painted to high standard. Definately a learning experience.
I was proud of it for short time, but now I see that there is a long road ahead...

What to improve:
-- subassembly... but finally bought a precise proxxon tool so my life will be a lot easier now
-- base is not contrasting enough with the cape, should paint the base after the mini. More color is required (green/red)
-- nmm is clunky in some places, reds are flatt. More contrast is needed. Steel is ok but too much white!
-- learn to add proper weathering? Too clean here for a traitor marine ;)
-- have to paint more explicitly, lots of areas have just a highlight, and small variation.
