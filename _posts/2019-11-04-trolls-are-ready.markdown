The trolls are ready finally.
the good: 
* got some knowledge on making big surfaces interesting (reflections on bellies). Not perfect, but will help in next works
* they are bright, quite high contrast
* did base painting in 3hrs, and had fun with pigments. Still a bit torn on the idea.
* had fun with brushstrokes, textured blending & volumes

the bad:
* maybe more thought on the base? Some people like it, some not. Good basing is tough
* didn't write up color mixes for their backs. Two have slightly different color
* 3x large model with flat surfaces is tough to paint in cosistent, high standard. Will avoid that :D
