The aim here was to practice NMM gold. I'm quite happy with milliput-sculpted base & it's painting. What should be improved: just spending more time on blending/sharpness, increase darkness in shadows, especially on lower parts. Do quite intense colour reflections from the base to bind mini & base together & increse the overall interest.

Cheers!
