First entry. This blog is aimed to be my painting log, place to store ideas, problems, inspiration and random thoughts.

Reverend healer from corvus belli done!

After ~13hrs I finally managed to finish. Really nice fig, albeit hard to paint due to tiny details. 
Really different from usual GW stuff that I do. Tried some new things: red nmm, yellow OSL on vambraces, black nmm, bronze nmm on old gear at base. 
Aimed for high contrast paintjob, shiny but cold. Color scheme is a bit similar to official one, which is fine by me, as nowadays I'm in some kind of white-blue-red phase :)
Parts of the model were painted under brand new velleman vtlamp6, which really made a difference in color perception. Great product, if you're looking for a good light source for your 
miniature needs, search no more- review on coloreddust: http://www.coloureddust.com.pl/2012/09/desk-working-lamp-velleman-vtlamp6.html.
Inspired by some massivevoodoo art (http://massivevoodoo.blogspot.com/2011/11/discovering-new-hands.html) I also practiced with new hand position, 
elbows on the desk, it was hard to get rid of old habits, but in the end better precision was achieved.

Experienced couple of problems, mainly with smoothness. After priming with fresh can of corax white warmed in a jar of water, the surface turned out a bit grainy, which impacted
whole paintjob. Maybe it was caused by the fact it was a fresh can of spray, or lack of sandpaper prep. Also I'd like to try some flow improver/retarder as it was hard
to keep the paint from drying at the tip of the brush when doing final edge highlights, perhaps I should change brush movement a bit. 

Nevertheless I'm pretty pleased how she turned out, I particularly like the face. Photos suck as always, will work on that.

Cheers!
