First entry. This blog is aimed to be my painting log, place to store ideas, problems, inspiration and random thoughts.

**Reverend healer from Corvus Belli done!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After ~13hrs I finally managed to finish. Really nice fig, albeit hard to paint due to tiny details, quite different from usual GW stuff that I do, more demanding. It was an opportunity to try some new things:

*  Red & black nmm
*  Bronze nmm on old gear at base
*  Yellow OSL on vambraces

Aimed for high contrast paintjob, shiny but cold. Color scheme is a bit similar to official one, which is fine by me, as nowadays I'm in some kind of white-blue-red phase :)
Parts of the model were painted under brand new velleman vtlamp6, which really made a difference in color perception. Great product, if you're looking for a good light source for your miniature needs, search no more ([review on coloreddust](http://www.coloureddust.com.pl/2012/09/desk-working-lamp-velleman-vtlamp6.html)).

Inspired by some old [massivevoodoo article](http://massivevoodoo.blogspot.com/2011/11/discovering-new-hands.html) I also practiced with new hand position, 
elbows on the desk, it was hard to get rid of old habits, but in the end better precision was achieved.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Experienced couple of problems, mainly with smoothness. After priming with fresh can of corax white warmed in a jar of water, the surface turned out a bit grainy, which impacted
whole paintjob. Maybe it was caused by the fact it was a fresh can of spray, or lack of sandpaper prep. Also I'd like to try some flow improver/retarder as it was hard
to keep the paint from drying at the tip of the brush when doing final edge highlights, perhaps I should change brush movement a bit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nevertheless I'm pretty pleased how she turned out, I particularly like the face. Photos suck as always, will work on that.

Cheers!
