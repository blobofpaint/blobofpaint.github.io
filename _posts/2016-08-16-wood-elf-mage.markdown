Another fast paintjob for my friend's warheim/mordheim wood elves warband. Took ~5hrs. I like the sculpt, freehand and eyes turned out ok, but overally I must admit it's quite bland and missess the atmosphere. Next stuff: finish bonard and get to the next project: harlequin shadowseer (this one probably won't be very smooth, but I'll try to have some fun with turquise).
