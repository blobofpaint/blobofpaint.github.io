&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time has passed, currently I'm the US till 10th july and have no paints with me, still wanted to share something painted about 3 weeks ago for a friend. Next thing will be finalizing bonard and then some tabletop stuff: resistance force for dropzone commander - so instead of bust painting I previously wanted I'll do some 10mm :) have to figure out painting scheme, though.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There we have a wood elf musician/ministrel from reaper. One of my fastests paintjobs, overall it took only 3.5hrs during pair-painting with other friend. Quite ugly mini for my taste, nevertheless I enjoyed working on it somehow :) Experimented a bit with leather on the pants (paint dabbing), put some sparkling highlights on red hair, did purple eye pupils with white dots (never use pure white on eyeballs aside from sparks!).
Trivial green/red contrast, perhaps should have made the instrument dark-reddish, now there is too much bronze. Also the tree she's sitting on, her pants & ground kind of melt together, I'll add lots of moss/leaves/static grass to the base to distinguish it more.
