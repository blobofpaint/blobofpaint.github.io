WiP of my new mini, aimed to be set-up at some kind of dark future/post apo desolated pleasure district. 
It will come with a small diorama, representing an obliterated part of the city. Used some colors from my new vallejo fairy paint set, great paints. I particularly like more muted ones.
Again, trying to improve my contrast game, did some cold shadows & purple to suggest dusk/early evening.
